# ml_performance_benchmarks
Just a github backup of some of the common benchmarks I typically run to gauge performance of the devices i'm running on. 


Only contains a simple notebook for now, will add more once the models are obfuscated. Existing notebook forked from : https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-apple-silicon/blob/main/01_cifar10_tinyvgg.ipynb
